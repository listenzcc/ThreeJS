## Three Practice

My Practice for using [Three.js](http://www.webgl3d.cn/ "Three.js").

Since the Python Computation Backend is used,
I have built a Django server to answer the web request
to support the `Three.js` usage.
The Django server name is `threeServer`.

### Installation

Install with `npm` or `cnpm`

```shell
# Either of the following is OK
npm i three
cnpm i three
```

### Examples

The **Examples** are the Instances for practising.

It is worth to mention the deployment of the examples.

- The `.html` files in the templates folder, named like `example-2.html`, are the main page of the examples;
- The example folder, named like `src-example-2`, in the `static` folder of `threeServer` contains the private files.

### example-1

Dump Example on the homepage of the official website.

### example-2

My own building for functional-separated structure.
